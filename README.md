# Movie Scraper

Movie Scraper is a Python script that allows you to scrape movie data from a website. You can specify the range of movie pages you want to scrape and gather information about various movies.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Movie Scraper on your local machine:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-scraper.git
    ```

2. Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. You can typically install these libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install library-name
    ```

    Replace `library-name` with the actual names of the libraries your script relies on.

3. Modify the script:

    - Open the script and locate the `basic_url` variable. Change the URL to the website you want to scrape.
    - In the `movieList` variable, specify the range of movie pages you want to scrape. For example, you can set it to `range(1, 11)` to scrape the first ten pages of movies.
    - You can also adjust the range in `random.randrange(0, 26)` to choose a different page to start scraping if you wish.

4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python movie_scraper.py
    ```

    Replace `movie_scraper.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

## Usage

Once you've configured and run the script, it will start scraping movie data from the specified website. The scraped data may include details like movie title, release date, cast, ratings, and more, depending on your script's implementation.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to scrape data from the website you are targeting, and ensure that you respect the website's terms of use and guidelines.
